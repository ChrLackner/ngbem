ngbem: Add-on to NGSolve implementing boundary element methods 

Online documentation: https://weggler.github.io/ngbem/intro.html

ngbem is an add-on library to Netgen/NGSolve, a general purpose, high performance finite element library for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. 

The add-on enables the used of the higher order element methods. Both, Netgen/NGSolve and ngbem are written in C++/C with a small Python interface
through which it is typically used. ngbem is work i an academic software. Goal of the project is to offer fast boundary element methods for all standard problems. 

ngbem is work in progress. The current status comprises an Python interface to solve boundary value problems for Laplace, Helmholtz and Maxwell equations.
